# Py-Smart-Calc
A robust command-line calculator built to perform arithmetic and statistical operations. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Python programming, including function definition, control flow, and user input handling.

# 📖 About
This project is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application that prompts the user to input two numbers and select a mathematical operation. It is designed to be a quick and efficient tool for basic calculations.

Supported Operations:
1. Addition: Sum of two numbers.
2. Subtraction: Difference between two numbers.
3. Multiplication: Product of two numbers.
4. Division: Quotient of two numbers.
5. Average: Calculates the mean of two inputs.
6. Percentage: Calculates percentage based on a cumulative total of 200 (useful for exam scoring).

# 🧠 Prerequisite Knowledge
To understand or modify this code, familiarity with the following is recommended:
* Basic Python Syntax: Understanding how to write and execute a Python script.
* Data Types: specifically Integers (int) and Strings (str).
* Input/Output: Using input() to get data and print() to display results.
*Mathematical Logic: Basic arithmetic rules.

# 🛠️ Concepts Used
The code implements several core programming concepts:
* Functions (def): Modular code blocks for each operation (add, sub, multiply, etc.) to keep the logic clean and reusable.
* Control Flow (if-elif-else): A decision-making ladder used to execute the specific function corresponding to the user's choice.
* Type Casting: Converting raw user input (strings) into integers using int() for mathematical processing.
* String Formatting: Concatenating strings and variables to display the final equation clearly (e.g., num1 + num2 = result).

# 🚀 How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the calculator on your local machine:

* Ensure Python is Installed
Make sure you have Python installed. You can check by running:
```bash
python --version
```

```
*Navigate to the Directory
```bash
cd Py-Smart-Calc
```
*Run the Script
```bash
calc.py
```
